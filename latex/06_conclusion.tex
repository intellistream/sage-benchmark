\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

SAGE proposes a shift from ad-hoc LLM application scripts to principled, declarative inference pipelines.
By unifying the runtime, middleware, and control plane under a strict six-layer architecture, SAGE enables global optimizations that are impossible in fragmented stacks.
Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach not only improves raw performance and resource isolation but also provides the necessary observability to co-optimize agentic behavior and system efficiency.
Future work will focus on extending the compiler to support automatic graph partitioning across hybrid cloud-edge environments.
