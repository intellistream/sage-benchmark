"""Benchmark and testbed utilities focused on the SAGE system as a whole.

This package is intended for experiments and benchmarks that treat SAGE as
an end-to-end dataflow-based ML systems platform, not just an LLM
control plane. It can host ICML-oriented experiment configs, runners,
analysis code, and writing prompts.
